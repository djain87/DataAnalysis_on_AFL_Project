# DataAnalysis_on_AFL_Project

The data represents metrics measured for each game in the Australian Football League from 2012 to 2021. The dataset is created from afltables.com and www.footywire.com. This is not just the results and player stats of AFL games but also details on individual games.

The purpose of the task is to predict performance and results, and who the key players are.   

Project Approach
I got this dataset from Kaggle and it contains information such as players, games and stats. I used Python to clean and analyze this dataset. This analysis is divided into several stages: data cleaning, data exploration, an insight section, and recommendations.
Data model is understanding the data by identifying tables or entities and columns. 
Game entity or table contains information about match details for every AFL game from 2012 to 2021. Each match identified by a unique 'gameId'.
Players entity or table contains information for each individual AFL player, identified by a unique playerId.
Stats entity or table contains information about game stats for each individual player,in every game. 

I performed Exploratory Data Analysis to better understand data. It allows you to obtain confidence in your data at any point when you are ready to engage in a Machine learning algorithm. It also allows you to refine your feature variables that we will use later for develop modelling. It helps us to uncover hidden trends and patterns to generate insights that derive data driven decision making and support bussiness initiatives.
Before working on any analysis or dataset, it is essential to ensure that dataset is clean and reliable. The data cleaning process involves removing duplicate values, handling missing values, identify outliers, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting the data for analysis. In this project, we carefully cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy and integrity of our findings.
