# DataAnalysis_on_AFL_Project

# Project Overview

AFL data represents metrics measured for each game in the Australian Football League from 2012 to 2021. The dataset is created from afltables.com and www.footywire.com. 
I got this dataset from Kaggle and it contains information such as players, games and stats. I performed exploratory data analysis using pandas for data manipulation and visualization using matplotlib  to better understand data. 

This Exploratory data analysis is divided into several stages:
 
Data Preparing: Importing and reading data from data sources.

Data Processing : Before working on any analysis or dataset, it is essential to ensure that dataset is clean and reliable. 
The data cleaning process involves removing duplicate values, handling missing values, identify outliers, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting the data for analysis.
In this project, we carefully cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy and integrity of our findings.

Analyze : I have used python as a tool to analyse the dataset. I create compelling Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to share my findings and results in an appleaing way.

# Problem Statement
The goal of this project to perform indepth analysis of gaining valuable insights to predict performance, results and who the key players are.

# Task
a.	Find average goals scored in Home matches for each team

b.	Find average goals scored in Away matches for each team

c.	Find the win rate for Home vs Away for each team

d.	Which team won the maximum games back to back

e.	What were the top 5 years with the most games held?

i.	Based on the top years, which 3 venues had the most games held during this period? 

f.	What were the bottom 5 years with the least games held?  

g.	Does the distribution for the crowd in attendance follow a normal distribution? If not briefly describe the type of distribution. 

# Knowledge gained from this project:
a. Imporing various libraries to perform numerous tasks.

b. Learn loading data, data cleaning, data processing in python.

c. I performed statistical techniques and performed aggregations to analysze the dataset to solve the tasks.

d. Gained confidence in doing EDA
