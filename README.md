# DataAnalysis_on_AFL_Project

Project Overview

AFL data represents metrics measured for each game in the Australian Football League from 2012 to 2021. The dataset is created from afltables.com and www.footywire.com. This is not just the results and player stats of AFL games but also details on individual games. The goal of this project to perform indepth analysis of gaining valuable insights to predict performance, results and who the key players are.

Project Approach

I got this dataset from Kaggle and it contains information such as players, games and stats. I performed exploratory data analysis using pandas for data manipulation and visualization using matplotlib  to better understand data. It allows you to obtain confidence in your data at any point when you are ready to engage in a Machine learning algorithm. It also allows you to refine your feature variables that we will use later for develop data modelling. Data modeling is understanding the data by identifying tables or entities and columns.  It helps us to uncover hidden trends and patterns to generate insights that derive data driven decision making and support bussiness initiatives.

This Exploratory data analysis is divided into several stages:
 
Data Preparing: Importing and reading data from data sources.

Data Processing : Before working on any analysis or dataset, it is essential to ensure that dataset is clean and reliable. The data cleaning process involves removing duplicate values, handling missing values, identify outliers, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting the data for analysis. In this project, we carefully cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy and integrity of our findings.

Analyze : I have used python as a tool to analyse the dataset. I create compelling Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to share my findings and results in an appleaing way.

Tables Used: 
Game entity or table contains information about match details for every AFL game from 2012 to 2021. Each match identified by a unique 'gameId'.
Players entity or table contains information for each individual AFL player, identified by a unique playerId.
Stats entity or table contains information about game stats for each individual player,in every game.
